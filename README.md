# Deep Neural Network Project
<b> Objective: </b>  <br>
The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on a deep neural network.  <br>

<b> The goals of this project are as follows:</b> <br>
1. Load Dataset <br>
2. Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)  <br>
3. Data fetching and understand the train/val/test splits.  <br>
4. Implement and apply a deep neural network classifier including (feedforward neuralnetwork, RELU, activations)  <br>
5. Implement batch normalization for training the neural network  <br>
6. Print the classification accuracy metrics  <br>
